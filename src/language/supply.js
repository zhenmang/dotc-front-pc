// 下单时候增加确认提示，文案如下：

// 请仔细核对转账金额，您需要转账的金额是XX元，如实际付款金额＞订单金额，多余金额将无法退还，并不支持申诉；如实际付款金额＜订单金额，将有可能损失您的锁仓资产并扣除交易金额的0.5%作为赔付。
// Please check the transfer amount carefully. The amount you need to transfer is XX Yuan. If the actual payment amount is greater than the order amount, the excess amount will not be refunded and the appeal is not supported; If the actual payment amount is less than the order amount, you may lose your locked assets, and 0.5% of the transaction amount will be deducted as compensation.

// 请确认已足额支付转账金额，并且未产生冲账（银行因输入信息有误等原因拒绝交易），如未足额支付或未成功付款，将有可能损失您的锁仓资产并扣除交易金额的0.5%作为赔付。Please confirm that the transfer amount has been paid in full and there is no write off (the bank refuses the transaction due to incorrect input information). If you fail to pay in full or successfully, you may lose your locked assets 0.5% of the transaction amount will be deducted as compensation.
